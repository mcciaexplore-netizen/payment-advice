# AGENT_HANDOFF.md

**Purpose:** This is the single source of truth for any AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, or otherwise) working on this repo. Two agents are being used in parallel to build faster. This file exists so both agents start every session with the same ground truth instead of contradicting or duplicating each other's work.

**Rule: update this file as the LAST step of every session, before ending it, whether you are Claude Code or Codex.** If you finish work and don't update this file, the next agent (possibly the other one) will be working blind.

---

## 0. Ground rules for any agent starting a session

1. **Read this file completely before writing any code.**
2. **Run `git pull` / sync with `main` before doing anything else** — do not branch off a stale checkout, especially before touching `lib/db/migrations/`.
3. **Check the "Open Items" section (§4) before starting new feature work.** If there are unverified open items, prioritize closing them over starting something new, unless the human explicitly says otherwise.
4. **Do not modify files listed in "Do Not Touch Without Asking" (§5) without flagging it to the human first**, even if the change looks like an improvement.
5. **At the end of your session, update:**
   - §3 (Current State) with what you shipped
   - §4 (Open Items) — remove what you verified, add what you left unverified
   - §6 (Session Log) — one short entry, dated, naming which agent did the work
6. **Never assume the other agent's unverified claims are true.** If Codex's summary says "tests passed," and you're Claude Code picking up next, that's a claim to verify, not a fact to build on — especially for anything in §4.
7. **If you and the other agent's changes could conflict** (same file, same migration slot, same route), stop and tell the human rather than resolving it silently.

## 1. Project Overview

**MCCIA Payment Advice** — internal Finance app for Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries & Agriculture, replacing a handwritten paper form (`MCCIA/ACTT/PAD/013`) and its manual re-entry into TallyPrime.

Repo: `github.com/mcciaexplore-netizen/payment-advice`

Physical wet-ink signing still happens off-app. The app's job is only to **fill, track, and print** — it does not replace signatures.

## 2. Stack (do not change without asking)

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16, App Router, TypeScript |
| Hosting | Vercel |
| Database | Postgres (Neon) + Drizzle ORM |
| File storage | Vercel Blob |
| Validation | Zod + React Hook Form |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| PDF generation | `@react-pdf/renderer` (Node runtime — **never Puppeteer/Chromium**, it's unreliable on Vercel serverless) |
| Excel export | `exceljs` |
| Admin auth | Signed JWT, HTTP-only cookie, via `jose`, isolated in `lib/auth.ts` |

Design system: Navy `#0B1F3A`, Forest green `#2E8B57`, Amber `#E8A33D`. Headings: DM Serif Display. Body: Outfit.

## 3. Current State (update this every session)

**Last updated:** 29 July 2026, by Claude Code (committed Cash Voucher feature)

### Shipped — Phase 1 baseline (Claude Code)
- Public form `/` (no login): submitter, payee (vendor typeahead), bill/reference, payment mode (NEFT/Cash), enclosures, mandatory Tax Invoice + Approval/Budget PDF attachments
- Serial number generation: `MCCIA/2026-27/0001` format, gapless, transactional via `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`
- Send-back/resubmit via one-time signed edit token, `/edit/[token]`, 14-day expiry
- Admin area: login, submissions list with filters + totals, detail view, approve/send-back, vendor & recommending-authority CRUD
- Two Payment Advice PDF routes: admin-gated (post-approval) and public via UUID (pre-approval — since physical sign-off happens before Finance approval in MCCIA's real workflow). UUID-keyed, not serial-keyed, to stay enumeration-safe
- Excel export for Tally entry. Schema carries placeholder GST/TDS/Tally columns for not-yet-built Phase 2
- Data model: `vendors`, `recommending_authorities`, `payment_advices`, `attachments`, `serial_counters`, `audit_log`

### Shipped — Cash Payment Voucher feature (Codex; reviewed, verified, committed by Claude Code 2026-07-29, commit `b198449`)
- Second, additional PDF for Cash-mode submissions only. Payment Advice PDF stays mandatory for every submission regardless of mode.
- Digitizes MCCIA's old paper "Cash Payment Voucher" form, with field renames (see §7 for full mapping)
- "Nature of Expenditure" is now a repeatable line-item list (description + amount) for Cash mode, with a live auto-summed Total
- New table `cash_voucher_items` (FK to `payment_advices`), populated only when `payment_mode = 'CASH'`
- Migration `0002_nostalgic_carnage.sql` applied
- Voucher "No." reuses the Payment Advice `serial_no` — no separate numbering series
- Line-item total becomes `payment_advices.amount` — single source of truth for both PDFs
- `sanctioned_by_name` now filled by the **submitter at submission time** (new field) — not by Admin at approval
- Routes: `/api/advice/[id]/cash-voucher-pdf` (public, UUID-keyed) and `/api/admin/advice/[id]/cash-voucher-pdf` (admin)
- New component `lib/pdf/CashVoucherDocument.tsx`
- Frontend shows a second "Download Cash Payment Voucher" button for Cash submissions on the post-submit screen

## 4. Open Items (verify before building on top of these)

Status legend: 🔴 unverified / high risk · 🟡 unverified / lower risk · 🟢 verified

- 🟢 **Cash-voucher-pdf routes (public + admin) 404 correctly for NEFT submissions.** Verified 2026-07-29 by Claude Code, two ways: (1) live end-to-end against the real dev server + real Neon DB — inserted a real NEFT `payment_advices` row, hit both `/api/advice/[id]/cash-voucher-pdf` and `/api/admin/advice/[id]/cash-voucher-pdf`, got clean `404 {"error":"Not found"}` with `Content-Type: application/json` from both, no server-side errors in the log. Also spot-checked the CASH happy path on a real row — both routes 200 with a real single-page PDF. (2) Strengthened the existing mocked test in `lib/pdf/cash-voucher-routes.test.ts` to also assert `content-type` isn't `application/pdf` and the JSON body shape, not just the status code — guards specifically against a future regression that returns 200 with empty/garbage PDF bytes instead of 404. No code fix was needed; both routes already guarded on `paymentMode !== "CASH"` before doing any rendering.
- 🟡 Confirm Excel/Tally export column order is unchanged, and Cash rows' joined `nature_of_expenditure` string (line items joined with `"; "`) reads sensibly for Finance. *(Still unverified — not checked as part of the 2026-07-29 commit pass either.)*
- 🟢 **Admin detail view renders the itemized Cash Voucher breakdown line-by-line, not just the collapsed total.** Verified 2026-07-29 by Claude Code live: inserted a real Cash advice with 3 line items (Fuel/Tea and snacks/Repairs) into the real Neon DB, loaded `/admin/advice/[id]` as an authenticated admin session, confirmed all 3 descriptions and amounts render in a "Cash Voucher Items" table (`app/admin/advice/[id]/page.tsx`).
- 🟢 **The 2 skipped DB integration tests are pre-existing, unrelated to the Cash Voucher feature.** Verified 2026-07-29 by Claude Code with git evidence, not inference: `git status --short lib/serial.test.ts` shows zero uncommitted changes to that file (Codex never touched it), and `git log --oneline -- lib/serial.test.ts` / `git blame` show the entire `describe.skipIf(!testDbUrl)` block was written in the very first commit (`a782956`, "Initial build: Phase 1 MCCIA Payment Advice app") — before the Cash Voucher feature existed in any form, committed or not (it's still fully uncommitted as of this session; see session log). They're gated behind an optional `TEST_DATABASE_URL` env var by design, so `npm test` stays green with no live DB configured — not a bug, not a regression. Left skipped, as instructed; not unskipped.
- ⬜ **Undecided (needs human decision, not an agent decision):** should an "Expenditure Breakdown" column be added to the Excel export? Currently declined.
- ⬜ **Undecided (needs human decision):** should a "Verified by" field exist on the Cash Voucher? Paper form didn't have it — only the Payment Advice has that 4th signature box. Currently left off.

## 5. Do Not Touch Without Asking

- `lib/auth.ts` — admin JWT session logic
- `lib/serial.ts` — serial number allocation (gapless guarantee is load-bearing; a "cleanup" here can silently break FY rollover)
- Anything in `lib/db/migrations/` — always ask before editing or regenerating an existing migration; only ever *add* new ones
- The dual representation of `nature_of_expenditure` (structured `cash_voucher_items` for Cash + joined string on `payment_advices.nature_of_expenditure` for NEFT/Excel stability) — this looks redundant but is intentional. Don't collapse it to "just use the line items table" without checking Excel export first.
- PDF route enumeration pattern (UUID-keyed public PDFs, not serial-keyed) — this is a deliberate security choice to prevent bank-detail enumeration, not an oversight.

## 6. Session Log

Append one entry per session, newest at the top. Keep entries short — this is a changelog, not a diary.

```
2026-07-29 — Claude Code — Committed Codex's Cash Payment Voucher work
(commit b198449), on explicit human instruction, after independently
reviewing the full diff file-by-file first (not a blind `git add -A`).
Before committing: ran tsc/eslint/full vitest suite/`next build`, all
clean. Live-tested a real Cash submission end-to-end through the actual
/api/submit route (not mocks) — correct DB rows, correct joined
nature_of_expenditure, both PDFs render. Also resolved the remaining
open item from the entry below: live-verified the admin detail view
renders the itemized breakdown (moved to 🟢 in §4). Excel/Tally export
column-order item is still unverified — nobody has checked it yet.
Cleaned up all test rows/blobs created during verification. §4 and §3
updated to reflect commit hash; the "uncommitted work" flag from the
previous session no longer applies.

2026-07-29 — Claude Code — Verification pass on §4 open items. Committed
and pushed AGENT_HANDOFF.md only (13c6140) — nothing else in the working
tree. Verified open item #1 (cash-voucher-pdf 404 for NEFT) live against
real dev server + real Neon DB, both routes correct; no fix needed;
strengthened the existing mocked test in cash-voucher-routes.test.ts to
also assert non-PDF content-type, not just status code. Verified open
item #2 (the 2 skipped DB tests) with git evidence: pre-existing, from
the initial commit, unrelated to Cash Voucher. Did not unskip them.
IMPORTANT for next session (either agent): the entire Cash Payment
Voucher feature described in §3 as "Shipped" is NOT actually committed
to git anywhere — `git status` shows it as ~20 modified/untracked files
still sitting in the working tree, never pushed. §3's "Shipped" wording
is accurate for what exists on disk, not for what's in version control.
Did not touch, stage, or commit any of it (out of scope for this
session) — flagging so nobody assumes it's safe on a remote.
```

## 7. Reference: Cash Voucher field mapping (paper → app)

| Sanctioned by | Sanctioned by | kept, but now filled by submitter at submission, not Admin at approval |
| Payee's Signature | Payee's Signature | kept, blank on printout (wet-ink) |
| No. | No. | kept — reuses Payment Advice `serial_no` |
| Date | Date | kept |
| Rs./Ps. columns, Total | Rs./Ps. columns, Total | kept, Total now auto-summed from line items |
