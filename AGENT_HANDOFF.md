# AGENT_HANDOFF.md

**Purpose:** This is the single source of truth for any AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, or otherwise) working on this repo. Two agents are being used in parallel to build faster. This file exists so both agents start every session with the same ground truth instead of contradicting or duplicating each other's work.

**Rule: update this file as the LAST step of every session, before ending it, whether you are Claude Code or Codex.** If you finish work and don't update this file, the next agent (possibly the other one) will be working blind.

---

## 0. Ground rules for any agent starting a session

1. **Read this file completely before writing any code.**
2. **Run `git pull` / sync with `main` before doing anything else** — do not branch off a stale checkout, especially before touching `lib/db/migrations/`.
3. **Check the "Open Items" section (§4) before starting new feature work.** If there are unverified open items, prioritize closing them over starting something new, unless the human explicitly says otherwise.
4. **Do not modify files listed in "Do Not Touch Without Asking" (§5) without flagging it to the human first**, even if the change looks like an improvement.
5. **At the end of your session, update:**
   - §3 (Current State) with what you shipped
   - §4 (Open Items) — remove what you verified, add what you left unverified
   - §6 (Session Log) — one short entry, dated, naming which agent did the work
6. **Never assume the other agent's unverified claims are true.** If Codex's summary says "tests passed," and you're Claude Code picking up next, that's a claim to verify, not a fact to build on — especially for anything in §4.
7. **If you and the other agent's changes could conflict** (same file, same migration slot, same route), stop and tell the human rather than resolving it silently.

## 1. Project Overview

**MCCIA Payment Advice** — internal Finance app for Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries & Agriculture, replacing a handwritten paper form (`MCCIA/ACTT/PAD/013`) and its manual re-entry into TallyPrime.

Repo: `github.com/mcciaexplore-netizen/payment-advice`

Physical wet-ink signing still happens off-app. The app's job is only to **fill, track, and print** — it does not replace signatures.

## 2. Stack (do not change without asking)

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16, App Router, TypeScript |
| Hosting | Vercel |
| Database | Postgres (Neon) + Drizzle ORM |
| File storage | Vercel Blob |
| Validation | Zod + React Hook Form |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| PDF generation | `@react-pdf/renderer` (Node runtime — **never Puppeteer/Chromium**, it's unreliable on Vercel serverless) |
| Excel export | `exceljs` |
| Admin auth | Signed JWT, HTTP-only cookie, via `jose`, isolated in `lib/auth.ts` |

Design system: Navy `#0B1F3A`, Forest green `#2E8B57`, Amber `#E8A33D`. Headings: DM Serif Display. Body: Outfit.

## 3. Current State (update this every session)

**Last updated:** 29 July 2026, by human (context handoff from Codex session)

### Shipped — Phase 1 baseline (Claude Code)
- Public form `/` (no login): submitter, payee (vendor typeahead), bill/reference, payment mode (NEFT/Cash), enclosures, mandatory Tax Invoice + Approval/Budget PDF attachments
- Serial number generation: `MCCIA/2026-27/0001` format, gapless, transactional via `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`
- Send-back/resubmit via one-time signed edit token, `/edit/[token]`, 14-day expiry
- Admin area: login, submissions list with filters + totals, detail view, approve/send-back, vendor & recommending-authority CRUD
- Two Payment Advice PDF routes: admin-gated (post-approval) and public via UUID (pre-approval — since physical sign-off happens before Finance approval in MCCIA's real workflow). UUID-keyed, not serial-keyed, to stay enumeration-safe
- Excel export for Tally entry. Schema carries placeholder GST/TDS/Tally columns for not-yet-built Phase 2
- Data model: `vendors`, `recommending_authorities`, `payment_advices`, `attachments`, `serial_counters`, `audit_log`

### Shipped — Cash Payment Voucher feature (Codex)
- Second, additional PDF for Cash-mode submissions only. Payment Advice PDF stays mandatory for every submission regardless of mode.
- Digitizes MCCIA's old paper "Cash Payment Voucher" form, with field renames (see §7 for full mapping)
- "Nature of Expenditure" is now a repeatable line-item list (description + amount) for Cash mode, with a live auto-summed Total
- New table `cash_voucher_items` (FK to `payment_advices`), populated only when `payment_mode = 'CASH'`
- Migration `0002_nostalgic_carnage.sql` applied
- Voucher "No." reuses the Payment Advice `serial_no` — no separate numbering series
- Line-item total becomes `payment_advices.amount` — single source of truth for both PDFs
- `sanctioned_by_name` now filled by the **submitter at submission time** (new field) — not by Admin at approval
- Routes: `/api/advice/[id]/cash-voucher-pdf` (public, UUID-keyed) and `/api/admin/advice/[id]/cash-voucher-pdf` (admin)
- New component `lib/pdf/CashVoucherDocument.tsx`
- Frontend shows a second "Download Cash Payment Voucher" button for Cash submissions on the post-submit screen

## 4. Open Items (verify before building on top of these)

Status legend: 🔴 unverified / high risk · 🟡 unverified / lower risk · 🟢 verified

- 🔴 **Cash-voucher-pdf routes (public + admin) must 404 for NEFT submissions.** Not yet confirmed they don't error or silently 200 on empty data instead.
- 🟡 Confirm Excel/Tally export column order is unchanged, and Cash rows' joined `nature_of_expenditure` string (line items joined with `"; "`) reads sensibly for Finance.
- 🟡 Confirm the admin detail view renders the itemized Cash Voucher expenditure breakdown line-by-line, not just the collapsed total — Finance needs this to reconcile against the physical bill.
- 🟡 Confirm the 2 skipped DB integration tests (`npm test` → 13 passed, 2 skipped) are **pre-existing** skips, not new skips introduced by the Cash Voucher feature.
- ⬜ **Undecided (needs human decision, not an agent decision):** should an "Expenditure Breakdown" column be added to the Excel export? Currently declined.
- ⬜ **Undecided (needs human decision):** should a "Verified by" field exist on the Cash Voucher? Paper form didn't have it — only the Payment Advice has that 4th signature box. Currently left off.

## 5. Do Not Touch Without Asking

- `lib/auth.ts` — admin JWT session logic
- `lib/serial.ts` — serial number allocation (gapless guarantee is load-bearing; a "cleanup" here can silently break FY rollover)
- Anything in `lib/db/migrations/` — always ask before editing or regenerating an existing migration; only ever *add* new ones
- The dual representation of `nature_of_expenditure` (structured `cash_voucher_items` for Cash + joined string on `payment_advices.nature_of_expenditure` for NEFT/Excel stability) — this looks redundant but is intentional. Don't collapse it to "just use the line items table" without checking Excel export first.
- PDF route enumeration pattern (UUID-keyed public PDFs, not serial-keyed) — this is a deliberate security choice to prevent bank-detail enumeration, not an oversight.

## 6. Session Log

Append one entry per session, newest at the top. Keep entries short — this is a changelog, not a diary.

```
2026-07-29 — Human — Context handoff. Codex shipped Cash Payment Voucher
feature (see §3). Created this AGENT_HANDOFF.md to coordinate Claude
Code + Codex working in parallel going forward. Next: verify §4 open
items before further feature work.
```

## 7. Reference: Cash Voucher field mapping (paper → app)

| Paper form field | App field | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Pay to | Name of the Payee | renamed |
| Particulars | Nature of Expenditure | renamed, now a repeatable line-item list |
| Prepared by | Submitted by | renamed |
| Checked by | Recommended by | renamed |
| Debit to | *(removed)* | — |
| A/c Code | *(removed)* | — |
| Amount in Words | *(removed)* | — |
| Sanctioned by | Sanctioned by | kept, but now filled by submitter at submission, not Admin at approval |
| Payee's Signature | Payee's Signature | kept, blank on printout (wet-ink) |
| No. | No. | kept — reuses Payment Advice `serial_no` |
| Date | Date | kept |
| Rs./Ps. columns, Total | Rs./Ps. columns, Total | kept, Total now auto-summed from line items |
